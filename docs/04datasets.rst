Datasets
========

We have an increasing number of dataset that are available in the Functional Fusion framework. We are focussing on datasets with a large variety of tasks within the same subjects. These datasets are especially powerful to characterize the brain organization. Below is a description of datasets that have been brought into the framework, some of which are openly available for download, while others are available upon request.

Contributing datasets
---------------------
You can bring your imaging dataset into the required format and use the framework for analysis (see :ref:`import`). If you want to make your datasets available, please contact us. We are happy to test your dataset, and list it here. Most of the processed datasets are stored on Zenodo, and you can use the DOI to cite the dataset in your publications. The platform allows you to determine exactly whom with, and und er which conditions, you want to share your dataset.
