Datasets
========

An increasing number of dataset are available within the Functional Fusion framework. We are focussing on datasets with a large variety of tasks within the same subjects. These datasets provide an especially powerful way to characterize brain organization. Below is a description of datasets that have been brought into the framework, some of which are openly available for download, while others are available upon request.

Contributing datasets
---------------------
You can bring your imaging dataset into the required format and use the framework for analysis (see :ref:`import`). If you want to make your datasets available, please contact us. We are happy to test your dataset, and list it here. Most of the processed datasets are stored on Zenodo, and you can use the DOI to cite the dataset in your publications. Zenodo also allows you to determine exactly with whom, when, and under which conditions, you want to share your dataset.

Datasets that are available in the framework
